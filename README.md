# GRINDES - A Personal Cognitive Basis
> ***A 7-axis conceptual framework for structured thinking***

The root philosophical idea of making a personal cognitive basis had sparked during the second year of my postgraduate studies (late 2016).
After years of struggling I somehow extracted it into the digital form and drafted 7 primary axis for my personal cognitive basis.
Essentially I iteratively sorted and resorted out key actions, directions and dimensions of day to day life experience, then arranged it on a foundation of physics metaphors and linear algebra concepts. 
While I tried my best to keep the obtained cognitive basis vectors rather universal - this whole system is still very much subjective.
Finally (only recently), I discovered that a Large Language Model may help immensely with the daunting task of organizing raw thoughts formed by human natural intelligence into concise and beautiful form.
So together with **DeepSeek-V3**[^0] we co-designing an updated and much more coherent system presented here.

==THIS IS A WORK IN PROGESS - HERE ARE GUILDLINES FOR A CO-DESIGNER==
* *italics and ??? mark the most flexible parts that require validation and might be even reframed completely*
* regular text still requires rigor consistency check and may be subject to alternation and polishing
* ***semi-bold emphasizes anchors that are pretty much set in stone - yet when a new conversation starts with this file upload - full analysis of consistency is necessary**

First of all - for everyone to be on the same page, let's set the core definition. 
**Cognitive basis - 'a set of orthogonal, interpretable dimensions that structurally decompose cognitive processes’**
For this personal cognitive basis I decided that each axis/dimension:
- Encodes a primitive cognitive function 
- Limits symbolism to metaphoric anchors (no pseudo-science)
- Defensible: no unnecessary overreach into neuroscience
- Maps into implementable operations (ideally) and examples

## Cognitive Basis Summary Table

Here is an overview of 7 basis axis/vector concepts as columns and corresponding anchors/ideas arranged by rows. Rows are sorted in the descending order of flexibility: from fixed concepts (most logically sound) to various applications and reflections of the basis (likely with some overthinking).

> Various math courses I had to take during university education did not stick in my head as fully and clearly as I would prefer. Still, I was really affected by a single simple idea presented throughout the major part of mathematics. To me it became the most important principle way beyond the math itself - it formed my outlook on any complex problem in general. Underlying concept for this principle/idea is called ***basis*** and that is exactly as it presented in [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)): **a set of axis in a vector space that allows every element of that space to be written as a finite linear combination of these axis unit vectors**.
